# Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental part of programming. An array is a list of data. We can store a lot of data in one variable, which makes our code more readable and easier to understand. It also makes it much easier to perform functions on related data.Here we can store heterogeneous data in an array. we can add string type,int type,boolean type and other type data in a single array.

The data in arrays are called **elements**.
Length of the array can be calculated by using a property **length**.

Here is a simple array:

```javascript
// 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 are the elements in this array
var numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8];
var len=numbers.length ;//returns no of element avaliable in an array.
```
